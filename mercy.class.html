            <h3> Introduction</h3>

            <p> Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare 
                the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you</p>
                
                <h3> Dependency management</h3>

            <p> Composer is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project. By default, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency manager.
                     It does however support a "global" project for convenience via the global command.</p>

             <p> This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler.</p>

             <p> Suppose</p>
                 <ol>
                        <li> You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li>
                        <li> Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li>
                 </ol>

              <p> Composer</p>

                  <ol> 
                        <li> Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.</li>
                        <li>Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed,
                            and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).</li>
                        <li> You can update all your dependencies in one command.</li>
                  </ol>

                <p> See the Basic usage chapter for more details on declaring dependencies.</p>
